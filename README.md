# Eye Disease Diagnosis with Deep Learning

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for my thesis project on diagnosing eye diseases using deep learning models, including Vision Transformers.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a system for automatically diagnosing common eye diseases using medical images. The model leverages deep learning techniques to assist in identifying diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

### Clone the Repository:
```console git clone https://github.com/amirmtaghizadegan/vision-transformer-eye-diagnosis.git
cd eye-disease-diagnosis
```

### Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then, install the required Python packages:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and run the model:
```console
jupyter notebook eye_disease_diagnosis.ipynb
```
## Notebook Overview

The notebook includes:
* Data Loading and Preprocessing: Steps to load and prepare medical imaging data.
* Model Implementation: Code for training Vision Transformer and other deep learning models.
* Evaluation: Functions to assess model performance using various metrics.

## Future Work

- Enhance model accuracy with more data.
- Explore new architectures and techniques.
